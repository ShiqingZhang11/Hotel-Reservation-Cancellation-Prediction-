# Hotel-Reservation-Cancellation-Prediction-
Supervising Task: Binary classification, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, and data-driven recommendations.
Conclusion
In this project, we explored hotel booking cancellations and the factors influencing them. Our analysis covered data pre-processing, visualization, and model training to predict cancellations.

Key Findings
Cancellation Rate: The dataset revealed a cancellation rate of 37.14%, with City Hotels experiencing higher cancellation rates than Resort Hotels.
Seasonal Trends: Cancellation rates were higher from November to February, peaking in January. Marketing campaigns during these months can help mitigate cancellations.
Market Segments: Higher cancellation rates were observed for bookings made through Travel Agents and Tour Operators, especially for room types A and D.
Country of Origin: Portugal had the highest number of reservations and cancellations. Enhancing hotel quality in high-cancellation countries could be beneficial.
ADR Insights: Average Daily Rate (ADR) analysis showed higher ADRs for cancelled reservations. Hotels could adjust pricing strategies to balance cancellations and revenue.
Model Performance
We evaluated four classifiers: Random Forest, Decision Tree, AdaBoost, and LightGBM. Here are the results:

Random Forest:
F1 Score: 0.6870
Accuracy: 0.8441

Decision Tree:
F1 Score: 0.5713
Accuracy: 0.7889

AdaBoost:
F1 Score: 0.3037
Accuracy: 0.7573

LightGBM:
F1 Score: 0.6820
Accuracy: 0.8365
The models provided reasonable accuracy and F1 scores, with Random Forest and LightGBM performing the best overall.

Recommendations
Pricing Strategies: Offer competitive room price discounts on weekends, holidays, and during high-cancellation months (November to February).
Marketing Campaigns: Launch targeted campaigns in January with attractive offers to boost revenue.
Improve Services: Enhance the quality of services in high-cancellation regions like Portugal.
Dynamic Pricing: Implement dynamic pricing strategies based on real-time demand and booking patterns to reduce cancellations.
By addressing these factors, hotels can improve their reservation management, reduce cancellations, and maximize revenue.
